# DevOps Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the DevOps Learning Roadmap! 

This guide is crafted to be your companion on the exciting journey of mastering DevOps practices. 

Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your skills, this roadmap breaks down the learning process into levels, each focusing on essential topics.

## Purpose and Structure

I created this roadmap to provide a structured path for your learning journey. It is designed with levels, and for each notable topic, there are mini projects to test your proficiency. 

These projects are crafted to reinforce theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience.

At the end of everything, you'll find full-blown end-to-end CI/CD projects. 

These projects are comprehensive and offer the opportunity to bring together everything you've learned into a real-world scenario.

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Levels:** Start from Level 1 and progress through each level sequentially.
2. **Projects:** Engage in the mini projects within each level to apply what you've learned.
3. **Collaborate:** Share your progress, seek feedback, and collaborate with the community for a richer learning experience.
4. **CI/CD Projects:** Take on the end-to-end CI/CD projects at the end to solidify your skills.

## Need Guidance?

If you find yourself unsure of how to approach any of these projects, don't worry! You can leverage the power of AI to help break down the complexities. Engage AI to provide step-by-step guidance, offering you a clear starting point and a guide to tackle the challenges.


I hope you find this roadmap helpful in your DevOps learning journey. Remember, the key is not just to learn but to apply your knowledge through hands-on projects and engage with the DevOps community. 

I will keep updating this with more resources.

Happy learning!
